    // Field of application in safety analysis:
    //    We use the convention "first 'success' (in our case failure) in step number k (for k in 1,2,3,...)
    //    The ExponentialDistribution can only be used in the CTMC-Mode of Prism. But in many cases we
    //    want to use the DTMC-Mode where the Discrete Distribution can be used (see Note below). So Continuous Distributions
    //    have to be approximated by Discrete Distributions. The mathematical background model of MTTF (Mean
    //    Time To Failure of a safety critical component) is the Continuous Exponential Distribution.
    //    Reliability(t) = Probability[No occurrences of system failure until point of time t].
    //    For further details on MTTF see ContinuousDistributions.fs/ExponentialDistribution.
    // Detailed description in:
    //    Inference of the formula [BW page 57,61]
    // Relationship to continuous Distribution:
    //    The continuous Exponential Distribution is also memoryless [WikiExp,WikiGeo].

    // Cumulative Distribution Function P (X <= k) :
    //    P (X >= k) = (1-p)^(k-1)  <--- p is the probability of a failure in one step. This formula says "nothing went wrong in the first k-1 steps, the 'coin' flipped to 'no failure'"
    //    P (X < k) = 1 - P (X >= k) = 1 - (1-p)^(k-1)   <---- This describes the probability of a failure within the first k-1 steps ("something went wrong in the first k-1 steps")
    //    P (X <= k) = P(X < k+1) = 1 - P (X >= k+1) = 1 - (1-p)^k   <---- This describes the probability of a failure within the first k steps ("something went wrong in the first k steps")
    // Probability Mass Function (pmf)    (P (X = k), analogue to Probability Density Function):
    //    P(X = k) = p * (1-p)^(k-1)     <---- a failure occurred exactly in step number k the first time
    // Expected Value of P:
    //    E(X) = 1/p <---- average number of the step, where the first time
    // Variance of P:
    //    V(X) = (1-p)/(p^2)
    // Note:
    //    * \Omega\prime = \mathbb{N}. Sample Space are the Natural Numbers.
    //    * In the initial state k=0 the probability of an error should be 0
    //    * In CTMCs, the values of the different possibilities for the next state from a source state do not need to sum to one
    //      because they are meant as lambdas of exponential distributions. I.e. "[] state = 1 -> 1:(state'=1) + 0.2:(state'=2) + 333:(state'=3);"
    //      is perfectly fine. Thus deterministic time delays are not that easy to add to a model in CTMCs. This is actually the main
    //      reason we make this approximation.
    //    * The prism FAQ shows a way to approximate deterministic time delays (~ steps in DTMCs) using an "Erlang distribution".
    //      See FAQ entry "How can I add deterministic time delays to a CTMC model?"
