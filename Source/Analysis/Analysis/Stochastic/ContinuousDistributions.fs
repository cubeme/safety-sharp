    // Field of application in safety analysis:
    //    Reliability(t) = Probability[No occurrences of system failure until point of time t].
    //    Used to determine the reliability of a component when the failure rate of a component is _constant_ 
    //    (i.e. the probability that a component fails in the time period [t,t+c] (where c is a constant)
    //    is independent of the point of time t, memoryless). We denote this constant failure rate with \lambda.
    //    "[...] the majority of reliability analysis is based on an assumption of a constant failure rate"
    //    [SCSS page 165].
    //    "The failure rate of a device is the number of failures within a given period of time" [SCSS page 164].

    //    Inference of the formula [FTH page X-20]

    // Relationship to discrete Distribution:
    //    The discrete Geometric Distribution is also memoryless [WikiExp,WikiGeo].
    //    Geometric Distribution converges to Exponential Distribution

    //    F(t) = Failure(t) = 1 - e^(- \lambda * t) (if t > 0)
    //    Reliability(t) = e^(- \lambda * t) //Also called the Complementary Cumulative Probability in statistical terminology

    //    safety analysis. Thats also the reason we defined here Reliability(t) for convenience.
