    // Removal of the quantification in the assignment rule is necessary, to automate the transformation and find a compact formula.
    // Formula for sp:
    //    sp(\phi, x:=e) = (\exists v^{<}. Q{ x \substby  v^{<} } \wedge e{ x \substby  v^{<} } )
    //    v^{<} contains a possible value of the "previous" x. There might be more values, see example.
    //    The x in the expression is replaced by its former value. The \exist collects all former values of
    //    variable x. This is actually needed, when the former value may be a set (example x>=4).
    // Example smokeTest20.sam, first branch:
    // v^{<}
    // { y >= 2 }
    //	    x := 1;
    // { [y >= 2 ] \wedge x = 1}    // the '[' ']' marks Q.
    //	    x := y + 3;
    // { [y >= 2 \wedge 1 = 1 ] \wedge x = y + 3}. The only value for x, which satisfies x=1 is 1. Thus, 1 = 1.
    //	    x := y + x;
    // { [y >= 2 \wedge 1 = 1 \wedge y + 3 = y + 3 ] \wedge x = y + y + 3 }. The only values for x, which satisfies x = y + 3 is y + 3. Thus, y + 3 = y + 3.
    //	    y := x + 2;
    // { ([ 2 >= 2 \wedge 1 = 1 \wedge 2 + 3 = 2 + 3 \wedge x = 2 + 2 + 3] \wedge y = x + 2) \vee 
    //   ([ 3 >= 2 \wedge 1 = 1 \wedge 3 + 3 = 3 + 3 \wedge x = 3 + 3 + 3] \wedge y = x + 2) \vee ... }. There are more possible values for y, which satisfy y >= 2. E.g. 2 >= 2 or 3 >= 2, ... And we cannot find an abbreviation as in the step before. Thus, we have to enumerate them all somehow.
    //      ...
    // See [CC96 Appendix A] for a detailed motivation.
    
    // Here we implement the version of [GCFK09], which requires a passive form. Details on how to transform structured code were taken from [CC96].
    

    // Returns the strongest postcondition of stm and a list of proof obligations that are needed as requirements,
    // that this strongest postcondition is true. If the proof obligations are not fulfilled, the resulting formula
    // is not guaranteed to be valid.
    // These proof obligations mainly originate from assertions.
    // Weakest Precondition is easier. It doesn't create additional proof obligations for assertions and has
    // no exists in the assignment rule. To enable an easy translation, we require passive form. For details on the
    // assignment rule see [CC96].
    // [GCFK09] doesn't need a complicated assignment rule, because the input program is in passive form.
