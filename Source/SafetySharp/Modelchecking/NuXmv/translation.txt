Decicions:
Structure of NuXmv-Model
[ ] Flatten all: Destructure partitions and components by putting everything into one big MODULE (Components and Partitions).
	- Not really human readable
	+ Promela-Way (alternatives are technically not possible there)
	+ Counterexample-Traces are really easy reconstructable
[x] Flatten only components: Destructure Components and put the code inside the ASSIGN-Constraint of its Partition in the correct processing order (sequence), but keep Partitions seperate and structured. ASSIGN-Constraints are written down in the order, in which they appear in the progam code (program sequence).
	+ Good tradeoff. Comments in the ASSIGN-section after a change of a component may help to guide throw the NuXmv-Code. Reason: Program sequences between different Components may interleave.
[ ] Keep all: Don't destructure anything. ASSIGN-Constraints are written down per Component in the order how they are processed inside the component. It is assured, these constraints can be solved by a topological sorting by NuXmv.
	+ NuXmv-Model fits really good to C# model
	- But the real processing order of constraints is hidden. Reason: Program sequences between different Components may interleave.
How to threat structures which are used as parameters (TODO)
[ ] Keep: Introduce a MODULE-Definition for every structure type. For every call of a method with a structure-parameter instanciate this structure.
[ ] Flatten: For every function call: Get the basic variables and use them as variables

To think about:
When to introduce a real variable and when is a define enought?
- When a variable is introduced inside a method, a define should be enought (one define for every "(re-)assignment in c#"). Except: Non deterministic choices.
- For state-variables: Only on non deterministic choices and the last time a variable is written to a real variable has to be introduced. (Are these the next(var)-constraints?)
- (For now: only use real variables are used. We optimize later)
- Intuition: Better to use INVARS than next-Contraints (a:= xxx better than next(a)). Especially for non-deterministic choices which do not depend on an assignment to the next state. Next must exist, because it joins the current state with the previous state. But when is it possible to "prepone" assignments to the current state? Or is it possible to always use next(x):=next(y); I think latter should work when topological sortable, but removes the possibility to replace by a define. Use next(x):=next(y) and postpone decisions about optimizability to later. Thus: Every current value is "defined" and the result of the previous step. Every value which is set in a step is only the result of a next.
- Consider: "ASSIGN a := exp;" is equivalent to "INVAR a in exp;"
