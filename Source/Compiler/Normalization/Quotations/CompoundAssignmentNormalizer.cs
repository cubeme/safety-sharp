	/// <summary>
	///     Replaces all compound assignments by simple assignments with the appropriate expression. The C# specification states
	///     that a compound assignment of the form <c>x op= y</c> is evaluated as <c>x = x op y</c>, expect that x is evaluated only
	///     once. The fact that x is evaluated only once is important in regular C# code; for instance, consider <c>M()[0] += 1</c>,
	///     where M is a function returning an integer array. If M() returns a different array for each invocation, the difference
	///     between evaluating M() once or twice when processing the compound assignment might be observable. Within components of
	///     SafetySharp models, however, we only ever allow assignments to fields, locals, and parameters of primitive types, such
	///     as int, bool, or decimal while arrays and structs are immutable and therefore cannot be assigned to at all. This
	///     simplifies the normalization of compound assignments, as we don't have to ensure that the expression on the left hand
	///     side of the assignment is evaluated only once.
	/// 
	///     For example, compound assignments such as <c>x += 1</c> or <c>y -= x + 1</c> are normalized to <c>x = x + (1)</c> and
	///     <c>y = y - (x + 1)</c>, respectively.
